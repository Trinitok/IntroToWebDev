			<p>Rushing Kappa Theta Pi is very easy! Show up to as many of the free events as you like and start making friends. We typically have four or five events per rush, and rush is always winter quarter. These are social events where you are supposed to get to know your peers. We want to see if you would be a good fit socially and professionally for Kappa Theta Pi, so you're at an advantage the more events you show up to.</p>
