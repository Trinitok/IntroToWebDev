			<p>Kappa Theta Pi is a professional fraternity that is heavily invested in technology. At the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology chapter, members must have a major, minor, or extreme interest in computing technology. We hold professional seminars for our members in order for them to network and gain important technical skills. Though we are young, we have a strong sense of brotherhood and host both social and professional events. <a href="index2.html">click here!</a></p>

				<br />

					<li>Entrepreneurship Lectures</li>
					<li>Talks given by professionals who work in the field</li>
					<li>Interview Skills Workshop</li>
